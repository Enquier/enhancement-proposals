✨Proposing a new OEP?✨

Make sure that you have at least done the following:

1. **Create a GitHub issue**  in the OpenMBEE Enhancement Proposal repo that
 1. Briefly outlines the proposal
 2. Suggests a review team (optional)
 3. Declares why it should be a OEP (See the “OEP / Not-a-OEP Rubric” below.)
2. **Identify a Shepherd** to see the process through. (Shepherds are assigned
   on a round-robin basis from a set of interested engaged volunteers).
3. **Decide if it's a OEP** according to the criteria listed above. The Shepherd decides if the OEP criteria have been met.
4. **Used the new OEP markdown template** to help structure your thoughts. You can find it in `openmbee-enhancement-proposal-guidelines/TEMPLATE.md` in this repository.
